This was chosen to be roughly the value for star forming galaxies at these
redshifts as measured by the WiggleZ survey. The assumption here is that FRBs
might trace star formation, although this is entirely speculative. It also
provides some contrast with the electrons, since some terms are proportional to
b_e - b_f. This is now stated in the text.

This was a very helpful comment and led us to include a b_f=0.7 line in Figure
3. We conclude that the sensitivity is indeed dominated by the integral term
and that a survey with 10000 events is unlikely to distinguish any signature of
the intrinsic clustering.

Time dependence of b_f should similarly be a small effect on the final
sensitivity. We've added a paragraph about the affect of the biases on the
various terms in the modelling section.

Figure 2 is intended to give a hint of this structure. The integral term and
the cross term are fairly insensitive to radial separation since any structure
in the radial integral will correlate. The radial dependence is actually
dominated by A(\chi).  As shown in the figure, the local term drops rapidly at
higher separations. We would very much like to show more curves in the style of
Figure 2 but space constrains preclude this.

We've added a brief statement about this in the discussion.  We hope that the
reviewer finds this satisfactory.

Our error bars depend on \ell binning and thus a band is inappropriate.
We have switched to filled boxes.  This is consistent with the style in 
Scott Dodelson's text book.
