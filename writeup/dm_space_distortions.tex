    We propose that `standard pings', brief broadband radio impulses, can be
    used to study the three-dimensional clustering of matter in the Universe
    even in the absence of redshift information.  The dispersion of radio waves
    as they travel through the Universe, like redshift, can be used as a
    cosmological distance measure.  Due to inhomogeneities in the electron
    density along the line-of-siight dispersion is an imperfect proxy for
    radial distance and we show that this leads to calculable dispersion-space
    distortions in the apparent clustering of sources. Fast radio bursts (FRBs)
    are a new class of radio transients that are the prototypical standard
    ping, and due to their high observed dispersion from intervening plasma,
    have been interpreted as originating at cosmological distances.  The rate
    of fast radio bursts has been estimated to be several thousand over the
    whole sky per day, and if cosmological, the sources of these events should
    trace the large-scale structure of the Universe.  We calculate the
    dispersion-space power spectra for a simple model where electrons and FRBs
    are biased tracers of the large-scale structure of the Universe and show
    that the clustering signal may be detectable in a survey with as few as
    $10000$ events.  Upcoming wide-field radio telescopes, like the Canadian

\section{Introduction}

The clustering of matter on large scales has been
heralded as the next great probe of the Universe after the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). The large-scale structure in principle contains far more
information than the CMB because it can be studied in three dimensions.
Traditionally the redshift of spectral lines, caused by the Hubble flow, has
been employed to measure radial distance and provide the third dimension.
Such redshift
surveys have now aggregated the positions of millions of galaxies into three
dimensional density maps, exposing a rich structure of clusters, filaments,
walls and voids.

However, redshift is not the only measure of radial distance.   Standard
candles and standard rulers can be used to estimate distance using brightness
and angular size respectively.  In the same way a \emph{standard ping}, a brief
broadband radio impulse, can be used to estimate radial distance because of the
characteristic $\lambda^2$ dispersion of electromagnetic signals along the
line-of-sight as a function of wavelength.  This technique, widely used as an
approximate distance indicator to pulsars in the Galaxy, can be used to define
the \emph{dispersion distance} to cosmological sources.

due to intervening plasma
is readily measured from fast radio bursts (FRB) which are a class
of radio transient first reported by \citet{2007Sci...318..777L}.
There have since been 
10 such bursts reported
\citep{2012MNRAS.425L..71K,2013Sci...341...53T,
2014ApJ...790..101S, 2014ApJ...792...19B, 
2015MNRAS.447..246P,2015ApJ...799L...5R} and total rate of bursts
been estimated to be $3.3^{+5}_{-2.5} \times 10^3$
per sky per day \cite{2015arXiv150500834R}. 
The dispersion measure
(DM) is a line-of-site integral of the free electron density and can thus be
used as a distance estimate, as is routinely done with galactic pulsars.
FRB events are observed to have dispersion measures of order
$1000\,{\rm pc} / {\rm cm}^3$, greatly in excess of
the galactic expectation of order $100\,{\rm pc} / {\rm cm}^3$, depending on
galactic latitude
\cite{2014arXiv1412.4829D}.
They must therefore be of extra-galactic origin, with their
dispersion produced either by the
inter-galactic medium (IGM) \citep{2013Sci...341...53T} or the
environment of the source
\citep{2014ApJ...785L..26L,2015arXiv150101341P,2015arXiv150505535C}.
If the dispersion is dominated by the inter-galactic medium,
then the average DM--distance relation can be modelled
\citep{2014ApJ...797...71Z,2004MNRAS.348..999I, 2003ApJ...598L..79I}
and the sources are at
cosmological distances of a few gigaparsecs. This would permit
the study of the clustering of FRB sources in three dimensions which should trace the
large-scale structure of the Universe on linear scales. Note that although we
frame our discussions in terms of FRBs, dispersion may be 


Neither redshift nor dispersion measure are perfect proxies for radial distance.
Redshifts are systematically biased by the peculiar velocities of the object
relative to the Hubble flow. This leads to additional apparent clustering
in redshift
space which was first calculated by \citet{1987MNRAS.227....1K}
using linear theory.
Similarly, distance estimates from dispersion measure will be biased by
inhomogeneities in the electron density \citep{2014ApJ...780L..33M},
again leading to additional apparent
clustering of sources in dispersion measure space.  In this letter we calculate
these DM-space distortions and consider the detectability of the signal by
upcoming surveys.


%\section{Density perturbations in dispersion measure space}
\section{Clustering in dispersion measure space}

The dispersion measure of a signal observed in some angular direction $\hat{n}$ and
originating from comoving radial distance $\chi$ is
\begin{equation}
    {\rm DM}(\hat{n}, \chi) = \int_0^{\chi} \ud\chi' a(\chi)^2
        n_e(\hat{n}\chi', \chi').
\end{equation}
Here
$n_e(\vec{x}, \chi)$ is the free electron density as a function of location and
conformal time. Note that we use $\chi$ as our radial distance and time
coordinate, as opposed to redshift which is more appropriate for spectroscopic
applications. We model the cosmological 
electron density as containing a homogeneous part
and perturbations,
$n_e(\vec x, \chi) = \bar{n}_e(\chi) \left[1 + \delta_e(\vec x, \chi)\right]$.
The dispersion
measure is thus
\begin{equation}
    {\rm DM}(\hat n, \chi) = \int_0^\chi \ud\chi' a(\chi')^2 \bar{n}_e(\chi')
       \left[1 + \delta_e(\hat{n}\chi',\chi')\right].
\end{equation}

\emph{Dispersion measure space} is the three dimensional coordinates,
$\vec x_s$ inferred from the dispersion measure assuming that the electrons are
homogeneous. This only affects the radial coordinate such that $\vec x_s = \hat
n \chi_s$ with $\chi_s$ defined by the equation
\begin{equation}
    {\rm DM}(\chi_s) = \int_0^{\chi_s} \ud\chi' a(\chi')^2 \bar{n}_e(\chi').
\end{equation}

Combining the above equations (keeping only terms first order in the density
perturbations), we find that
\begin{equation}
\frac{\ud \chi_s}{\ud \chi} = 1 + \delta_e(\hat n \chi, \chi),
\end{equation}
and thus
\begin{equation}
\chi_s - \chi = \int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n \chi').
\end{equation}

We wish to relate the density of a tracer, $f$, measured in DM space to its
density in real space. We follow the derivation in \citet{1987MNRAS.227....1K}
of the
redshift-space distortions. Start by noting that the total number of tracers
in a volume element is the same in both spaces:
\begin{equation}
\label{e:density}
n_{fs}(\vec x_s) \ud^3\vec x_s = n_{f}(\vec x) \ud^3\vec x.
\end{equation}
We split the density into a homogeneous part plus perturbations,
\begin{equation}
    \bar{n}_{fs}(\chi_s)\left[ 1 + \delta_{fs}(\vec x_s)\right] \ud^3\vec x_s
    = \bar{n}_{f}(\chi)\left[ 1 + \delta_f(\vec x)\right] \ud^3\vec x.
\end{equation}
Averaged over the sky, $\langle \chi_s \rangle = \chi$ and thus the background
density should
be the same in DM space as in real space,
\begin{equation}
\bar{n}_{fs}(\chi) = \bar{n}_f(\chi).
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{align}
\bar{n}_{fs}(\chi_s) 
    &= \bar{n}_{f}(\chi) + (\chi_s - \chi)\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}\\
    &= \bar{n}_{f}(\chi)
       + \frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}\int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n
       \chi').
       \label{e:nfs}
\end{align}

The Jacobian in spherical coordinates is
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{\ud^3\vec x}{\ud^3\vec x_s} \right|
    &= \frac{\ud \chi}{\ud \chi_s}\frac{\chi^2}{\chi_s^2}\\
    &= (1 + \delta_e)^{-1}
       \left(1 + \frac{\int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n \chi')}
                      {\chi}\right)^{-2}\\
    &\approx 1 - \delta_e
        - \frac{2}{\chi}\int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n \chi').
        \label{e:jac}
\end{align}

Substituting Equations~\ref{e:nfs}~and~\ref{e:jac} into Equation~\ref{e:density},
we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{e:delta_s}
    \delta_{fs} = \delta_f - \delta_e
    - \left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}
    + \frac{2}{\chi} \right)
        \int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n \chi').
\end{equation}
In the equation above, the $-\delta_e$ term is most analogous to the Kaiser
redshift-space distortions.  It is a dilution of tracers in DM space due to an
excess of electrons between the tracers. However we note that this term is isotropic
in contrast to Kaiser.  This is because any wave vector electron perturbation
causes DM space distortions, whereas the radial velocities that cause
redshift-space distortions are only sourced by perturbations with radial wave
vectors.

The $\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}$ arise since the
misinterpretation of the radial distance causes the observed tracer density to
be compared to the wrong background density. The $\frac{2}{\chi}$ term is
caused by a misinterpretation of angular distances when the radial distance is
mis-measured.  In both cases analogous terms are in principle present in 
redshift space but are
negligible. Because radial velocities are only sourced by modes with large
radial wave vector, there is near perfect cancellation along the line of sight
and thus is very little net error in radial distance.

For brevity in the following sections we define the coefficient of the integral
term as
\begin{equation}
    \label{e:A}
    A(\chi) \equiv \frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}
    + \frac{2}{\chi}.
\end{equation}


%\section{Two-point statistics}

Large-scale structure is usually studied through its two-point statistics, most
commonly the power spectrum, $P(k)$.
Unlike in redshift-space distortions, Equation~\ref{e:delta_s} does not have a
simple form in harmonic space. The equation's third term couples harmonic modes
and thus the two-point statistics cannot be phrased as a simple power spectrum.
We will instead use $C^{ss}_\ell(\chi,\chi')$, which is
the cross-correlation angular power spectrum of the DM-space over density,
on shells at $\chi$ and $\chi'$:
\begin{align}
    &C^{ss}_\ell(\chi, \chi') =
    \int\ud\Omega\ud\Omega' Y_{\ell m}(\hat n) Y^*_{\ell m}(\hat n')
    \langle \delta_{fs}(\hat n \chi) \delta_{fs}(\hat n' \chi')
        \rangle.
\end{align}
The first two terms in Equation~\ref{e:delta_s} are stationary. For stationary,
isotropic, tracers $x$ and $y$ we have 
$\langle \delta_x(\vec k, \chi) \delta_y(\vec k', \chi) \rangle = (2\pi)^3
\delta^3(\vec k - \vec k') P_{xy}(k, \chi)$.  If for a moment we ignore time
dependence, the angular cross-power spectrum of such tracers is
\begin{align}
    %\delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{mm'}C^{xy}_\ell(\chi, \chi')
    %&= \int\ud\Omega\ud\Omega'Y_{\ell m}(\hat n) Y_{\ell' m'}(\hat n')
    %    \langle \delta_x(\hat n \chi) \delta_y(\hat n' \chi') \rangle,
    %    \\
    C^{xy}_\ell(\chi,\chi')
    &= \frac{2}{\pi}
\int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 j_\ell(k\chi) j_{\ell}(k\chi')P_{xy}(k).
\end{align}
In reality the power spectrum evolves on the order of a Hubble time.
The angular cross correlations will be very small unless $\chi$ and $\chi'$ are
within a few correlation lengths of one another, roughly a hundred
megaparsecs.  The evolution of the power-spectrum is negligible over these time
differences which leads to a straight-forward way to include the evolution of
the perturbations:
\begin{align}
C^{xy}_\ell(\chi,\chi') 
    \approx \frac{2}{\pi}
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2
    j_\ell(k\chi) j_{\ell}(k\chi')
    P_{xy}(k,(\chi + \chi')/2),\nonumber &\\
    |\chi - \chi'| \ll 1/aH.&
\end{align}

The third term in Equation~\ref{e:delta_s} is not stationary but is an integral
over the stationary field $\delta_e$.
Define $\delta_d$ as
\begin{equation}
    \delta_d(\hat n \chi) \equiv \int_0^\chi \ud \chi' \delta_e(\hat n \chi').
\end{equation}
It is straight-forward to show that
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
C^{dd}_\ell(\chi,\chi')
    =
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    \int_0^\chi\ud\chi''
    \int_0^{\chi'}\ud\chi'''
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 j_\ell(k\chi'') j_{\ell}(k\chi''')
    P_{ee}(k, (\chi''+\chi''')/2).
\end{equation}

Finally, $C^{ss}_\ell$ will contain cross terms between the stationary terms
and the integral terms.  These will have the form
\begin{equation}
C^{dx}_\ell(\chi,\chi')
    =
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    \int_0^\chi\ud\chi''
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 
    j_\ell(k\chi') j_{\ell}(k\chi'')P_{ex}(k, (\chi' + \chi'')/2).
\end{equation}

Assembling all these expressions with the proper coefficients we have
\begin{align}
    \label{e:Clss}
C^{ss}_\ell(\chi,\chi') = &~
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2
    j_\ell(k\chi) j_{\ell}(k\chi')
    P_{[ff + ee - 2ef]}(k, (\chi + \chi')/2)
    %\left[
    %P_{ff}(k, \bar\chi)
    %+ P_{ee}(k, \bar\chi)
    %- 2P_{fe}(k, \bar\chi)
    %\right]
    \nonumber\\
    & +
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    %\left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}
    %+ \frac{2}{\chi} \right)
    %\left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi'}
    %+ \frac{2}{\chi'} \right)
    A(\chi) A(\chi')
    \int_0^\chi\ud\chi''
    \int_0^{\chi'}\ud\chi'''
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 j_\ell(k\chi'') j_{\ell}(k\chi''')
    P_{ee}(k, (\chi''+\chi''')/2)
    \nonumber\\
    & +
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    %\left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi}
    %+ \frac{2}{\chi} \right)
    A(\chi)
    \int_0^\chi\ud\chi''
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 
    j_\ell(k\chi') j_{\ell}(k\chi'')
    P_{[ee - fe]}(k, (\chi' + \chi'')/2)
    %\left[
    %P_{ee}(k, (\chi' + \chi'')/2)
    %- P_{fe}(k, (\chi' + \chi'')/2) 
    %\right]
    \nonumber\\
    & +
    \frac{2}{\pi}
    %\left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_f}\frac{\ud \bar{n}_f}{\ud \chi'}
    %+ \frac{2}{\chi'} \right)
    A(\chi')
    \int_0^{\chi'}\ud\chi''
    \int_0^\infty\ud k k^2 
    j_\ell(k\chi) j_{\ell}(k\chi'')
    P_{[ee - fe]}(k, (\chi + \chi'')/2).
    %\left[ 
    %P_{ee}(k, (\chi + \chi'')/2)
    %- P_{fe}(k, (\chi + \chi'')/2) 
    %\right].
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
Here, expressions such as $P_{[ff + ee - 2ef]}$ are short hand for $P_{ff} +
P_{ee} - 2P_{ef}$.

Equation~\ref{e:Clss} can be simplified substantially by adopting the small
angle and Limber approximations \citep{1953ApJ...117..134L,
1992ApJ...388..272K, 1998ApJ...498...26K}.  The small angle
approximation eliminates the $k$ integral over spherical Bessel functions, replacing it
with a Fourier transform, and is valid for $\ell \gg 1$. The Limber
approximation assumes that only modes with small radial component of their wave
vector contribute to the radial integrals and is valid if the power spectra
evolve slowly compared to the correlation length \citep{2008PhRvD..78l3506L}
(which has already been
assumed). With these approximations we have
\begin{align}
    &C^{ss}_\ell(\chi, \chi') \approx
    \nonumber \\ & \quad
    \frac{1}{\bar\chi^2}
        \int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\ud k_\parallel}{(2 \pi)} 
        e^{i k_\parallel (\chi - \chi')}
        P_{[ee + ff - 2ef]}
        (\sqrt{k_\parallel^2 + \nu^2/\bar\chi^2}, \bar\chi)
    \nonumber \\ & \quad +
    A(\chi) A(\chi')
    \int_0^{\chi_{\rm min}}\ud\chi''
    \frac{1}{\chi^{\prime\prime 2}}
    P_{ee}(\nu/\chi'',\chi'')
    \nonumber \\ & \quad +
    \frac{A(\chi_{\max})}{\chi_{\min}^2}
    P_{[ee - ef]}(\nu/\chi_{\min}, \chi_{\min}),
    \label{e:Clss_limber}
\end{align}
where $\nu\equiv\ell + 1/2$, $\chi_{\min} \equiv \min(\chi, \chi')$,
and $\chi_{\max} \equiv \max(\chi,
\chi')$ .  We've found that these approximations are excellent for $\ell
\gtrsim 10$
and use this form for the remainder of the paper. In the above equation we dub
the three terms the `local', `integral' and `cross' terms respectively and will
refer to them as such henceforth.


\section{Modelling and measurement}

There are a number of effects that will complicate the measurement of the
above calculated angular power spectrum by a real survey of dispersion 
measures.  The first effect is
that the model that the free electron density decomposes into a homogeneous
part plus a random field of perturbations is not complete. Firstly, all signals
must pass through the Milky Way's galactic disk, halo, and local environment,
which will contribute to the dispersion measure. However, this is only a
single function of $\hat n$ which can presumably be well
measured. In addition, this function could in principle be well characterized
by independent data such as observations of pulsars.  As such, it should be
possible to subtract the local
contribution, as was done in
\citet{2014arXiv1412.4829D}, and this is unlikely to be a limiting obstacle.

More concerning is the dispersion from the source's environment
as well as the halo in which it resides. These electrons will presumably be
clustered around the source on scales far smaller than DM-space
structure map pixels and thus are not accounted for in the $\delta_e$--$\delta_f$
correlations included in the above formalism.  This will have a mean
contribution, common to all sources and which may be epoch dependant, that will
modify the mean DM--distance relation. This will need to be calibrated in some
why or else fit with nuisance parameters during parameter estimation.  There
will also be a stochastic piece which varies from source to source.  This will
limit the precision at which $\chi_s$ can be measured, thus limiting the
resolution of DM space density maps in the radial direction.

Detailed treatment of the above complications is beyond the scope of this
work. The magnitude of the contribution from the progenitor is at present
unknown. To crudely deal with it here we use relatively large
$\chi$ bins of $100\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ in sensitivity estimates.

The second term in Equation~\ref{e:Clss_limber} is an integral that mixes
many spatial scales: small scales from smaller radial distance and larger
scales from greater distances. The mixing of scales complicates the
interpretation of measurements, since structure formation on scales smaller
than $\sim10\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ is non-linear and hard to model. A similar issue
exists in the field of weak gravitational lensing, where the formula for the
angular power spectrum has a similar form.  In lensing, a kernel in
the line-of-sight integral arising from geometric effects suppresses the
contribution from small distances, partially alleviating the issue.

There is an advantage to the lack of kernel in the DM-space integral term.
Lensing tomography---the use of sources at multiple redshifts to un-mix
spatial scales---is complicated by the kernel. The kernel's shape depends on
the source redshift, re-weighting the line-of-sight integral and
making tomography inexact.  In contrast the integrand in the DM-space integral
term is completely independent of the limit of integration, meaning
contributions from different parts of the line of sight (and thus different
spatial scales) can be separated exactly. Again, a detailed study of DM space
tomography is beyond the scope of this work.  To avoid our results being
sensitive to the hard-to-model small scales, we assume that the contribution to the
integral term from radial distances $\chi'' < 500\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ are well
measured by the correlations with these radial slices. We thus neglect the
information from these slices in our sensitivity measurements and ignore
contributions to the integral term from below this distance. The smallest
spatial scale that contributes the our plotted angular power spectra out to
$\ell=1000$ is thus $k=2\,h/{\rm Mpc}$.

For plotting the DM-space power spectra we use a toy model for the electron and
FRB clustering that assumes both are biased tracers of the dark matter:
\emph{i.e.}~$P_{xy}(k)=b_x b_y P(k)$.  We
calculate the time dependant dark-matter power spectrum using {\tt CAMB} using
the integrated {\tt HALOFIT} to approximate the non-linear evolution. We assume
that the electron bias is $b_e=1$, which should be true on large scales due to
the approximate conservation of free electrons. The bias of FRB sources is
unconstrained by data and we choose it to be $b_f=1.3$. The coefficient
$A(\chi)$ depends on the density of detected FRB sources, $\bar n_f(\chi)$.
We use a simple model where all events above a fixed flux are detected,
the intrinsic luminosity function has the
\citet{1976ApJ...203..297S} form with index $-1$, and events at the cut off of the
luminosity function and at
a radial distance of $\chi=2350\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ are at the flux detection threshold.
This source density is shown in Figure~\ref{f:n_f} with the resulting DM-space
power-spectrum in Figure~\ref{f:terms}.

        ``local term'' curve which is for $\chi - \chi'=50\,{\rm Mpc}/h$. 
        While
        the other two terms are highly insensitive to the separation of
        the radial slices, the local term drops rapidly with separation.

In first measurements of the angular power spectra, uncertainty will be
dominated by the finite number of observed dispersion measures, or shot noise.
The noise power spectrum on shells with of width
$\Delta \chi$ is
\begin{equation}
    C^N_{\ell, ij} = \frac{\delta_{ij}}{\bar n_f(\chi_i)\chi_i^2\Delta\chi}.
\end{equation}
Here, to indicate that we are now working with quantities binned in the radial
direction instead of
continuous functions, we've switched to $C_{\ell,ij}$ over 
$C_\ell(\chi, \chi')$. The uncertainty on the angular
cross-power spectrum is then
\begin{align}
    (\Delta{C^{ss}_{\ell,ij}})^2 = 
    {\frac{1}{\ell(\ell + 1)\Delta \ell f_{\rm sky}}}
        \left[C^N_{\ell,ii} C^N_{\ell,jj} +  (C^N_{\ell,ij})^2\right],
\end{align}
where the second term in brackets only contributes for $i = j$.

We consider the sensitivity of a survey with a total of $10^4$ dispersion
measures from FRB events distributed uniformly over half the sky. This is in rough
approximation to what could be achieved by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment's now funded FRB instrument over a three year survey.
To give an idea of the overall sensitivity of the survey, we collapse
$C^{ss}_{\ell,ij}$ to a single function of $\ell$ by taking a weighted average
of all pairs of radial bins. We use bin widths of $100\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ over the
range $500\,{\rm Mpc}/h$ to $3500\,{\rm Mpc}/h$.
For weights in the radial bin average, we use the signal over noise-squared
at $\ell=100$, which maximizes the signal to noise at that $\ell$ and
is near optimal at other multipoles.
We exclude the $i = j$ bin pairs
as they would be contaminated by noise bias in a real survey.
This effectively discards the contribution from the local term. The result is shown
in Figure~\ref{f:sensitivity}.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}

We have proposed using FRB sources as 3D tracers of the large-scale structure,
using dispersion measure to estimate radial distance. It can be seen in
Figure~\ref{f:terms} that the signal is dominated by inhomogeneities in the
electron density along the line of sight inducing mis-estimates of radial
distance and thus apparent clustering. These DM-space distortions could be used
to study the distribution of free electrons in the Universe on large-scales.
There have been other proposals to use FRB events to study large-scale
structure \citep{2014ApJ...780L..33M,2014MNRAS.443L..11D}, however these
schemes have either been two dimensional or required externally measured redshifts
for the sources. Additionally, there have been proposals to use the DM-redshift
relation to probe the background density of electrons and thus the expansion
history of the Universe
\citep{2014ApJ...783L..35D,2014PhRvD..89j7303Z,2014ApJ...788..189G}.

We have
shown that a survey detecting $10^4$ fast radio bursts of cosmological
origin (as might be achieved by the CHIME FRB instrument) could detect the
clustering signal.
Looking forward, DM-space
clustering could become a powerful probe of large-scale structure should
observational factors turn out to be favourable compared to spectroscopic
surveys. The baryon acoustic oscillation feature can be clearly seen in
Figure~\ref{f:terms} in the cross term and both
local-term curves. It may also be possible to extract the BAO feature
from the integral
term using tomography.
This however requires that the contribution to dispersion measure from
the source's environment and host halo be modest compared to the
contribution from the IGM.
