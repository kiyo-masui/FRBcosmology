Other corrections and comments
==============================

Figures have been type-set surprisingly small, about 30% smaller than we would
have expected.  This is fine, but surprising.

Line 40: \emph{standard pings} -> ``standard pings''.

Line 64 and 277: The inteneded meaning of "dispersion--distance relation" is 
"dispersion vs distance relation", which I believe needs a longer dash. In this
instance dispersion-distance is not an adjective.

Line 188: are -> is.  The subject of this sentence is "the Limber approximation"

Line 249 "amplitude ... depends" -> "amplitudes ... depend"
