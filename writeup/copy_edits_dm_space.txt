15) We have confirmed that links are correct.


Other corrections and comments
==============================

Line 40: \emph{standard pings} -> ``standard pings''.

Line 64 and 277: The intended meaning of "dispersion--distance relation" is
"dispersion vs. distance relation". In this instance dispersion--distance is not
an adjective. For clarity, please use "dispersion vs. distance relation"

Line 188: are -> is.  The subject of this sentence is "the Limber approximation"

Line 249 "amplitude ... depends" -> "amplitudes ... depend"

Lines 332 to 336: This paragraph is redundant with the following paragraph. The
two sentences in this paragraph are duplicated verbatim in the following
paragraph.  It was left in the manuscript in error. Please remove it.

Figures have been type-set surprisingly small, about 30% smaller than we would
have expected. If possible we would prefer, at least, figure 2 and 3 to be
larger. We understand if this is not possible for length or style reasons.
